Chapter: Colors

there are 3 types of colors:

Color Name
Hex Code 
RGB

Color Name:

there are 147 pre-defined color names that recognized browsers:

if we wanto to get multiple shades of 1 color eg: red, then we can do this by Hex Code 

if we want to style any element of html with the help of css, then first we need to select or call that html element in css file
then write curly brackets "{}" then under the brackets we write css by give property and value 

just hover the color name and select the different shades of that color by RGB Code

what does RGB mean?

r   =   red
g   =   green
b   =   blue

and there are 3 parameters in this value like:   rgb(255, 39, 39)
these 3 values are called parameters

1st value is red color
2nd valued is green color
3rd value is blue color

Mixture of Colors:

rgb means red, green and blue are the mixtures of all colors that will create different colors 

if we change the values of RGB parameter from rgb(255, 39, 39) to rgb(0, 0, 0) then it will become black color

OR 

if we change the values of RGB parameter from rgb(255, 39, 39) to rgb(255, 255, 255) then it will become white color

Limit of RGB Color Value:

the limit of RGB color value from 0 to 255 
if we type 256 then there is no shades of color exist to show you
